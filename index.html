                    <p class="large text-muted">Like a Bossa formed back in our high school years. Most of our performances then were unpaid opportunities to bring live music into the community.
						We performed at celebrations in our hometown and events at the high school, but the highlight of those years was a concert for disadvantaged young students; some of them
						had never heard jazz music or even seen a live performance before. After a couple of weeks of classroom visits to motivate the students to join the school band, we took
						to the auditorium stage to help inspire the next generation of musicians. We managed to hold the attention of kids between ages 6-11 for around an hour, putting a spin on
						music ranging from Disney classics to Chic Corea and Stevie Wonder while also giving them plenty to watch. With Dan playing two pianos at a time and 
						Gordon captivating the audience by dancing around and playing his familiar melodies, we were able to bring joy to those children in a way unlike anything we had seen before.</p>
					<p class="large text-muted">Although college has complicated rehearsing, our song selection is ever growing. Our combined musical taste promotes sampling from numerous genres and
						is delightful for listeners of all ages. No matter what your event is, we hope to help you make it truly remarkable! <span class="text-brand" >--Like a Bossa</span></p>
