# likeabossa-website

This repo is used to help manage [Like A Bossa's website](http://likeabossa.com). I, Daniel Caspers, am the sole maintainer and owner of the website.

## Implementation Details

This site was my way of teaching myself [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), so I decided that it would be best for me to not start from scratch. Therefore, I started off of a free, open source template and architected my site around it. However, one should keep in mind that while there are certainly similarities between the two, much of the website has been tailored to fit the needs of our band. Nearly all of the original code has been revised, refactored or reviewed by me in some way, so the template functioned more like a "rolling chassis" than a traditional template. 

## Thanks and Considerations
I owe many thanks to those at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) for providing the [Agency template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/). Without this, I may not have developed this personal site and would have lost out on the great learning opportunity developing this site has been. It has opened many doors for me both personally and professionally and I am grateful that they provided such a great template for me to start from. 

Below is the original readme.
